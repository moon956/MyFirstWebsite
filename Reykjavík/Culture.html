        <h2>Icelandic Cuisine</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        Hundreds of years ago the process of preserving food to last through the winter became an important part of the
        Icelandic cuisine. Today most of the traditional Icelandic food is still some form of meat that has gone through
        a fermentation process, each with a unique flavor that comes from how they are preserved. If you are interested
        in testing your taste buds you can take on the challenge of eating the fermented shark at the local flea market
        over the weekend.
